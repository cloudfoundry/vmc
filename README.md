# CLI for Cloud Foundry (ng or next generation)

The CLI for Cloud Foundry is being completely rewritten in the `ng` branch. It is not yet being shipped as a rubygem, so installation is only via source. Installation, usage & contribution instructions are below.

To use this CLI, your Cloud Foundry installation will need to be running <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng">cloud_controller_ng</a>, which is a part of the latest <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/master/jobs/cloud_controller_ng">cf-release</a>, but not yet part of Micro Cloud Foundry. That is, you can use this CLI against <a href="http://api.cloudfoundry.com" title="">http://api.cloudfoundry.com</a> but not the local VM version of Cloud Foundry.

## Public Cloud Foundries running Cloud Controller NG

You can use this ng/nextgen version of VMC with the following public hosts of Cloud Foundry:

* <a href="http://CloudFoundry.com">CloudFoundry.com</a>

Please submit a gerrit patch to update this list if your company is running cloud_controller_ng for its customers.

## Local installation

```
$ gerrit clone ssh://$(whoami)@reviews.cloudfoundry.org:29418/vmc
$ cd vmc
$ git checkout ng
$ bundle install
$ rake install
```

## Dual VMC

Once you have installed the ng version of VMC (for example, vmc 0.4.0.beta.84), you can use the stable VMC client at any time:

```
$ vmc _0.3.23_ -v  # stable CLI
vmc 0.3.23

$ vmc -v           # ng CLI
vmc 0.4.0.beta.84
```

## Usage

```
$ vmc help --all
