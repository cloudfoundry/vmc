Erlang Support
--------------

This application demonstrates Erlang support from vcap. The application was generated
using the Mochiweb "make app" command, and the only modification was to change:
  Web = web_specs(mochiweb_test_web, 8080),
to:
  Web = web_specs(mochiweb_test_web,
    case os:getenv("VMC_APP_PORT") of
      false     -> 9090;
      P         -> list_to_integer(P)
    end),

in mochiweb_test_sup:init, allowing for the VMC port to be injected.


Deployment
----------
To deploy this application, execute:
  vmc update erlang --url erlang.vcap.me

Note that you'll need erlang-nox installed on the cloud host.
